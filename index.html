          <h2>Hi.</h2>
          <p>I'm Max Pollard. I'm an aspiring game developer — currently focused on graphics programming, but I enjoy exploring all aspects of the craft.</p>
          <p>I started game development in the summer of 2024 through some Udemy courses in Unreal Engine. Since then, I've spread my wings and adopted a
            philosophy of following whatever part of game design currently excites me — often through personal, exploratory coding adventures.</p>
          <p>Most of what I do lives in the 90% complete range, functional, efficient, but lacking that 10% extra polish you might do for a production game - 
            it's to the point that I can't resist moving on to the next thing that excites me.
          </p>
          <p>This site is part portfolio, part devblog. I want to share what I'm working on and I think much of it speaks for my personal skills and growth.</p>

                <h2>Becalmed</h2>
                <p>Becalmed is my current hobby project, and often the challenges and things that excite me in that are what
                  lead me to do deep dives into specific things such as atmosphere rendering, shadow systems, terrain generation
                  and water shaders. So far there are no real goals of turning it into a playable game. It's just something to help
                  drive personal inspiration and a world I can enjoy being in.</p>
